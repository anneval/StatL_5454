# Exercise 1

Let's load the data
```{r Exercise 1.0, include=TRUE}
data("diabetes", package = "lars")
diab.data <- cbind(diabetes$y,diabetes$x)
colnames(diab.data)[1] <- "y"
head(diab.data)
```

Setting a seed (123) and splitting the data into test and training data set. We don't know if ht eorder is random. If it isn't random we get a bias using the first 400 observations.
```{r Exercise 1.1, include=TRUE}
# set seed
set.seed(123)
# generate & separate train and test data 
train.data <- sample(seq_len(nrow(diab.data)), size = 400)
train <- data.frame(diab.data[train.data, ])
test <- data.frame(diab.data[-train.data, ])
```

All or just training set ?
```{r Exercise 1.2, include=TRUE}
# Correlation atrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(diab.data, use = "complete.obs")
print(correlation_matrix)

# Correlation plot
pairs(diab.data)
```

```{r Exercise 1.3, include=TRUE}
# Fit linear regression model using all explanatory variables
lm <- lm(y ~ ., data = train)
summary(lm)

```
```{r Exercise 1.4, include=TRUE}
# Make predictions on the training set
pred_train <- predict(lm, train)

# Make predictions on the test set
pred_test <- predict(lm, test)

# Calculate MSE for the training set
(mse_train <- mean((train$y - pred_train)^2))

# Calculate MSE for the test set
(mse_test <- mean((test$y - pred_test)^2))

```

-   Explanation: Random selection
-   Explanation standardized
-   Interpret correlation

```{r Exercise 1.5, include=TRUE}
# Fit a smaller mdoel
lm_small <- lm(y ~ sex + bmi + map + ltg, data = train)
summary(lm_small)
```

```{r Exercise 1.6, include=TRUE}
# Make predictions on the training set
pred_train_small <- predict(lm_small, train)

# Make predictions on the test set
pred_test_small <- predict(lm_small, test)

# Calculate MSE for the training set
(mse_train_small <- mean((train$y - pred_train_small)^2))

# Calculate MSE for the test set
(mse_test_small <- mean((test$y - pred_test_small)^2))

```
Comparing small and full model using an F-test

```{r Exercise 1.7, include=TRUE}

(F.small <- anova(lm,lm_small))

```

Stepwise regression based on the AIC
```{r Exercise 1.8, include=FALSE}
stepwise <- step(lm, criteria = "AIC")
```
```{r Exercise 1.9, include=TRUE}
summary(stepwise)
```

```{r Exercise 1.10, include=TRUE}
# Make predictions on the training set
pred_train_step <- predict(stepwise, train)

# Make predictions on the test set
pred_test_step <- predict(stepwise, test)

# Calculate MSE for the training set
(mse_train_step <- mean((train$y - pred_train_step)^2))

# Calculate MSE for the test set
(mse_test_step <- mean((test$y - pred_test_step)^2))

```
Comparing stepwise and full model using an F-test

```{r Exercise 1.7, include=TRUE}

(F.small <- anova(lm,stepwise))

```

Best subset selection based on AIC.

```{r Exercise 1.11, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}

library(leaps)
subset <- regsubsets(y ~ .,data = train, nvmax = 10)
summary(subset)
```

!!!! PROBLEM !!!!

```{r Exercise 1.12, include=TRUE}
# Make predictions on the training set
pred_train_sub <- predict(subset, train)

# Make predictions on the test set
pred_test_sub <- predict(subset, test)

# Calculate MSE for the training set
(mse_train_sub <- mean((train$y - pred_train_sub)^2))

# Calculate MSE for the test set
(mse_test_sub <- mean((test$y - pred_test_sub)^2))

```




# Exercise 2

```{r Exercise 2, include=FALSE}
# Clear memory
rm(list=ls())

data("Wage", package = "ISLR2")

```

# Exercise 3

```{r Exercise 3, include=FALSE}

```

# Exercise 4

```{r Exercise 4, include=FALSE}
