  # This function estimates factors and loadings using principal component
  # analysis. The model is X = F^0 Lambda^0' + e, with X is T by N data matrix,
  # F is the the T by r factor matrix, Lambda is the N by r loadings matrix and
  # e is the T by r errors matrix. (Supercript k indicates k factors used.)
  #
  # Under F^k'F^k/T = I, maximizing the trace of F^k'(XX')F^k, \hat{F}^k = 
  # sqrt(T) times the eigenvectors of the k largest eigenvalues of XX'. Under 
  # Lambda'Lambda/N = I, we have Lambda_k_hat = sqrt(N) times the eignevectors
  # of X'X. It also implies \hat{F}^k = X \hat{Lambda}^k/N. (Bai & Ng, 2002).
  # The second choice is implemented here.
